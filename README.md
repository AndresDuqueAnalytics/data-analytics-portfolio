# Data Analytics Portfolio — Andrés Duque

I am a junior data / BI analyst, focused on using structured analysis to support business and strategic decision-making.

My work emphasizes:
- clearly defined business questions
- transparent assumptions and limitations
- clean data handling and documented transformations
- communicating insights in a way stakeholders can act on

This portfolio contains two case studies that reflect how I think and work as an analyst.

## Featured Projects

### EPL vs La Liga — Competitive Balance Analysis (Start Here)
**Role:** Data Analyst, Sports Analytics Advisory (Case Study)  
**Business question:** Using 2023/24 match-level data, what indicators suggest the Premier League is more competitive than La Liga?

**What this shows:**
- translating an abstract concept (competitiveness) into measurable indicators
